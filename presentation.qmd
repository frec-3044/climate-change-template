## What controls Earth's temperature?

-   Amount of energy received by the sun
-   Reflection vs absorption of sun's energy (albedo)
-   The amount of energy retained by the earth's atmosphere.

## Amount of energy recieved by the sun

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The path of the earth around the sun and the angle of the earth vary at different time scales.
-   Has been important influence for glacial periods (every 100,000 years) over the past 500,000 years.
-   Milankovitch Cycles

## Amount of energy received from the sun?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Sunspots -- reflect magnetic activity of sun, and sun's brightness.
-   Approximately an 11 year cycle

## Amount of energy reflected back to space {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Albedo (reflectivity)
-   Lighter things reflect more light energy
-   Darker things absorb more light energy (heat)
-   Creates positive feedback
-   Aerosols lead to increased reflection of solar radiation (Volcanic activity -\> cooling).

## Amount of energy retained by the atmosphere

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The greenhouse effect: Energy is retained.
-   Gases in the atmosphere trap heat (CO2, CH4, NOxs, CFCs)

## Global energy balance

## What is "global temperature"?

Global surface temperature is calculated by averaging the temperatures over sea and land.  Communicated as an anomaly.

## What is "global temperature"?

-   Many groups across the world have generated datasets of global temperature
-   One example, Hansen et al. 2010 from Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2010/2010_Hansen_etal_1.pdf
-   Compiled different datasets from weather stations all over the world.
-   Used a model to interpolate (smooth) data for land
-   Use bucket (ships) and satellite measurements calibrated with ship measurements for the ocean

## What would cause global temperature to change?

## How do we measure atmospheric CO2?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Dr. Dave Keeling started measuring the CO2 concentration in air in 1958
-   Collected air in vacuum cleared glass flasks and measured CO2 content
-   Still measured with the method today (as well as sensors)

## How do current changes compare to past climate?

-   The earth is 4.54 billion years old
-   The last ice age was 110,000 to 12,000 years ago with peak glaciation 22,000 years ago
-   The world looked different!
    -   Northern USA and Canada covered by ice (grey)
    -   Southern US covered by taiga (coniferous forest) and grassland
    -   Southern Europe was tundra

## Key questions in module

-   What is the evidence for a changing climate?
-   How do find & interpret data sources behind main climate change indicators?
-   How do we read and plot this data in a scriptable & reproducible manner?
-   How do we communicate technical analysis in notebook formats that combine code, text, and visuals?

## Key Data Science Objectives

- Reading in data with diverse and unexpected formats
- Searching for how to solve problems
- Question 10 has more independence for addressing a question with data.
